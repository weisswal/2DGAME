 Wallys 2D Game Project
 
 The program demonstrates a 2D Game made  built with SDL2 and C++ - complete with enemies, weapons, items, maps, and collision detectors.  It utilizese an
 Entity Component System which allows for easy building of game objects/assets 
 as well as future scalabilty.  The player will be able to Move around using the 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' buttons and once he picks up an item, he can attack with 'j'. 
Due to this Project being for Engineering studies it does not present a dedicated story - it focuses on the technologies, design, fucntionality and scalability.
