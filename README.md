 The program demonstrates a 2D Game made  built with SDL2 and C++ - complete with enemies, weapons, items, maps, and collision detectors.  It utilizes an Entity Component System which allows for easy building of game objects/assets
 as well as future scalability.  The player will be able to Move around using the 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' buttons and once he picks up an item, he can attack with 'j'. Due to this Project being for Engineering studies it does not present a dedicated story - it focuses on the technologies, design, functionality and scalability.
