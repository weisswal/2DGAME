 as well as future scalability.  The player will be able to Move around using the 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' buttons and once he picks up an item, he can attack with 'j'. Due to this Project being for Engineering studies it does not present a dedicated story - it focuses on the technologies, design, functionality and scalability.
